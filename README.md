# Diabetes-Prediction-Internship-Project

In this project, we create a logistic regression model to predict 

Given to us is a dataset called train.csv which contains attributes relating to -
  Pregnancies - No. of times person has been pregnant
  Glucose - Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
  BloodPressure - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
  SkinThickness - Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
  Insulin - 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
  BMI - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
  DiabetesPedigreeFunction - Diabetes pedigree function
  Age - in years
  Outcome - 0 or 1. 0 means person was not diagnosed with diabetes, and 1 means that person was diagnosed with diabetes
  ID - unique identifier for the given person

Given this, We want to understand whether on the basis of few medical diagnoses a female would show an early sign of being diabetic or not., our model produces a file predictions.csv 

Using logistic regression, we are able to reach the given accuracy range in predictions.
This project is part of the Edyst Internship Program.
